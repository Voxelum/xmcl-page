## Color Palette and Themes

XMCL supports customized colors, which include:

- Card color
- Top bar color
- Sidebar color
- Background color
- Basic component highlight color
- Error color

At the same time, XMCL has 2 default color schemes: `Light mode` and `Dark mode`.

:::tip 
The colors of the Dark mode and Light mode are stored separately in each mode, and switching the mode will switch the overall color palette.

## Background Effects

XMCL backgrounds support setting as:

- Image
- Video
- Particle effects

:::warning Note
The launcher will only save the `file path` of the background video. If the video is moved after selection, the background setting will be invalid.

This is not an issue with images, as image data is stored.
