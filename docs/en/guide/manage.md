# Data Storage

XMCL data is divided into two parts:

1. XMCL as a cache and database generated by chromium
2. Minecraft related data

## XMCL cache and database

The cache related to XMCL itself is stored in the system appdata path, which is different on different platforms.

::: code-group
```[Windows]sh
%AppData%\xmcl
```
```[Windows (APPX/appinstaller)]sh
# Version < 0.34
%LocalAppData%\Packages\XMCL_ncdvebj03zfcm\LocalCache\Roaming\xmcl
# Version >= 0.34
%LocalAppData%\Packages\XMCL_68mcaawk44tpj\LocalCache\Roaming\xmcl
```
```sh [macOS]
~/Library/Application Support/xmcl
```
```sh [Linux]
~/.config/xmcl
```

Do not delete the files here unless you know what you are doing.

Here you will find some `json` files used to store various configurations, and the database will also be stored here.

- [User data](../protocol/user.md). Stores users' accounts, skin links, etc. Stored in the `/user.json` file.
- [Global settings](../protocol/setting.md). Global settings, such as language, proxy URL, download node, etc. Stored in the `/settings.json` file.
- [Instance cache](../protocol/instance.md). Records the last selected instance path and the paths of all known instances. Stored in the `/instances.json` file.
- [Java cache](../protocol/java.md). Records detected Java paths, version information, etc. Stored in the `/java.json` file.
- [Resource database](../protocol/resources.md). Metadata for resource files, such as parsed mod information. Stored in `leveldb` format, in the `/resources-v2` folder.
- [Logs](../protocol/logs.md). XMCL historical logs. Stored in the `/logs` folder.

## Minecraft-related data

I believe you are very familiar with the directory structure of Minecraft data.
The data directory of XMCL is slightly different from that of Minecraft:

<script setup>
import CentraProjectTree from '../../../src/components/CentraProjectTree.vue'
</script>

<CentraProjectTree />

Most of the content is actually the same as Minecraft, among which the `instances` folder contains all instance files.
