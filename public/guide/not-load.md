## 🔍 Identifying Resource Issues

If you're experiencing download errors, the first step is to determine if you have a **resource connectivity issue**.

### How to Check Your Network Connections:

1. Open **Task Manager**

3. Go to the second tab
   ![Active Connections](guidephoto/task2.png)
4. Now check and see which ones were transmitted and which ones connected (if your connection is stuck, it means you don't have access to this resource)
